# Code-Quiz

This site features a coding quiz that I created with JavaScript with the help of JQuery. It starts by displaying a start page with instructions, a start button and a button to view high scores. The start button presents the first question with buttons for answer selection. A timer tracks how much time is left out of 30 seconds. Selecting an answer will display either "Correct!" or "Incorrect!" and then progress to the next question. After all questions have been answered or the time runs out, the user is presented with a form to enter a three character name for the high scores to be associated with their score. The page then displays the high scores. The high scores can also be displayed at any time using the "View High Scores" button.

# Usage

This repository is useful for testing new trivia and basic JavaScript knowledge of novice JavaScript programmers. It helps show how to create elements using JQuery, hide them, and create event listeners. It is a useful example of how to use local storage and JSON to create persistent data and display it. It features timers for both scoring and for showing messages like correct/incorrect for a limited time.
